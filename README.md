# PreDocCodingSample
This repoistory holds different files that I have written for my research assistant positions and my independent research. 

There is one file utilizing Python titled NBAContractScraping. This utilizes Python with Pandas, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to scrape information about NBA contracts from Basketball Reference for a personal project. 
The other file is a R file titled ThesisDataAnalysis. This used R to clean a replication package, import a novel dataset, construct and then estimate a utility function through maximum likelihood estimation.
